    __Counting Intervals:__<br>
    *(These entries measure durations or cumulative totals:)*<br>
        - __C (Cycles):__ Counts the number of flight cycles (one takeoff and one landing).<br>
        - __FH (Flight Hours):__ Measures the duration of time the aircraft is in the air from takeoff to landing for each flight segment.<br>
        - __BT (Block Time):__ Measures the total duration from Off Blocks to On Blocks, including taxiing, flight time, and any other movement time.<br>
