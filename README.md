1. ### **Journey Log**<br>
    __Recording Specific Time:__<br>
    *(Records exact times when certain events occur)*<br>
        - __Date:__ The specific date of the flight.<br>
        - __Off B (Off Blocks):__ The time when the aircraft starts to move from its parking position.<br>
        - __TO (Take Off):__ The time when the aircraft becomes airborne.<br>
        - __OG (On Ground):__ The time when the aircraft lands.<br>
        - __On B (On Blocks):__ The time when the aircraft comes to a complete stop at its parking position.<br>
    
    __Counting Intervals:__<br>
    *(Measures durations or cumulative totals)*<br>
        - __C (Cycles):__ Counts the number of flight cycles (one takeoff and one landing).<br>
        - __FH (Flight Hours):__ Measures the duration of time the aircraft is in the air from takeoff to landing for each flight segment.<br>
        - __BT (Block Time):__ Measures the total duration from Off Blocks to On Blocks, including taxiing, flight time, and any other movement time.<br>
        - __Tot FH (Total Flight Hours):__ Cumulative total of all flight hours the aircraft has logged over multiple flights.<br>
        - __Tot Blk (Total Block Time):__ Cumulative total of all block time the aircraft has logged over multiple flights.<br>
        - __Tot C (Total Cycles):__ Cumulative total number of flight cycles the aircraft has completed.<br>

2. ### **Logbook**<br>
    __Totals Brought Forward:__<br>
        - Usually has zero as initial entry in the logbook entry after the aircraft is manufactured or after a complete overhaul, unless the aircraft has accrued hours before the logbook was started.<br>
        - If the logbook is new but the aircraft has previous operational history the totals brought forward will come from the last entries of the old logbook.<br>
        - These totals are carried over from previous logbook pages or sections to maintain a continuous and cumulative record.<br>
            - __CSN (Cycles Since New):__ Cumulative total cycles since the engine was new, brought forward from the previous entries.<br>
            - __CSO (Cycles Since Overhaul):__ Cumulative total cycles since the last engine overhaul, brought forward.<br>
            - __TSN (Time Since New):__ Cumulative total flight hours since the engine was new, brought forward.<br>
            - __TSO (Time Since Overhaul):__ Cumulative total flight hours since the last engine overhaul, brought forward.<br>
            - __TAC (Total Accumulated Cycles):__ Cumulative total cycles for the airframe, brought forward.<br>
            - __TAT (Total Airframe Time):__ Cumulative total flight hours for the airframe, brought forward.<br>
        -   These cumulative totals are critical for tracking the operational life of various aircraft components and ensuring proper maintenance and regulatory compliance.<br>
        
    __Airframe Logbook:__<br>
        - __DATE:__ The date of the entry<br>
        - __CYCLES (Cycles):__ The number of complete flight cycles, which typically include one takeoff and one landing.<br>
        - __TAC (Total Accumulated Cycles):__ The cumulative number of flight cycles the aircraft has completed.<br>
        - __FLT TIME (Flight Time):__ The duration of a single flight, typically measured from takeoff to landing.<br>
        - __TAT (Total Airframe Time):__ The total accumulated flight hours the airframe has recorded.<br>
        - __BLOCK (Block Time):__ The time elapsed from when the aircraft first moves under its own power for the purpose of flight until it comes to rest at the end of the flight.<br>
        - __TOT BLOCK (Total Block Time):__ The cumulative total of all block times recorded.<br>

    __Engine Logbook (Left Hand and Right Hand)__
        - __CSN (Cycles Since New)__ The total number of flight cycles the engine has accumulated since it was new.<br>
        - __CSO (Cycles Since Overhaul)__ The total number of flight cycles the engine has accumulated since the last major overhaul.<br>
        - __FLT TIME (Flight Time)__ The total flight hours the engine has been in operation.<br>
        - __TSN (Time Since New)__ The total flight hours the engine has accumulated since it was new.<br>
        - __TSO (Time Since Overhaul)__ The total flight hours the engine has accumulated since its last major overhaul.<br>
